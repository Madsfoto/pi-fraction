# pi-fraction
Making continuously more accurate pi fractions (22/7 to 355/113 etc)


stolen from https://www.wired.com/2011/03/what-is-the-best-fractional-representation-of-pi/
Pi_est = n/d

First, I will start with n = d = 1.
If n/d is less than pi, I will increase n by 1.
If n/d is greater than pi, I will increase d by 1.
Repeat the above until my computer complains.
